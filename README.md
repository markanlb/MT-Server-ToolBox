# üñ• MT-Server ToolBox üñ•

üîΩüîΩüîΩ<br/>
Have you ever dreamed of being able to control your own remote server from a simple and ergonomic tool ?<br/>
If so, this tool is for you.<br/>
<br/>
The MT-Server Toolbox allows you to start a Local or Remote server, to be able to stop it, to be able to launch game server instances, to send custom commands, etc...<br/>
Not wanting Linux, and for maximum compatibility, everything is done in Powershell code with a few plugins like MahApps.Metro<br/>
However, it requires a minimum of coding knowledge to be able to use it.<br/>
<br/>
An installation guide is provided.<br/>
This tool is still in development and this guide is succinct.<br/>
Do not hesitate to share your questions, problems or improvements on Github ;)<br/>
<br/>

Next step :
- Response from the Server directly to the Toolbox Client ‚ÜîÔ∏è
- Code optimization ‚úçÔ∏è
