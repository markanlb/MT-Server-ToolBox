# MT-Server ToolBox

⚠️⚠️<br/>
Have you ever dreamed of being able to control your own remote server from a simple and ergonomic tool ?<br/>
If so, this tool is for you.<br/>
However, it requires a minimum of coding knowledge to be able to use it.<br/>
<br/>
For a long time, I was looking for a simple, modifiable and free tool to start, stop, send commands, chat with Discord, etc... on a remote or local machine.<br/>
Having found nothing that suited me and being a developer in my spare time, I decided to start making my own and share it with you.<br/>
Not wanting Linux, and for maximum compatibility, everything is done in Powershell code with a few plugins like MahApps.Metro<br/>
<br/>
An installation guide is provided.<br/>
This tool is still in development and this guide is succinct.<br/>
Do not hesitate to share your questions, problems or improvements on Github ;)<br/>
<br/>
Next step :
- Response from the Server directly to the Toolbox Client
- Code optimization
